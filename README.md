# Michel_Unity_Audio_Spatializer
Audio spatializer that modifies basic Unity audio parameters through code

# What the project does
It allows you to edit spatialized audio directly from the inspector, with independent parameters for each object to which the code is added. It allows you to use custom spatialized audio without installing additional packages. It works independently of Unity's core spatializer.

# Why the project is useful
If you need to separate playbacks with different spatialization settings. Normally, spatialization is enabled in Unity with a checkbox, but in this case, it becomes independent.

# How users can get started with the project
Once the file has been added to the project's assets, simply add the code to the desired object and modify its parameters. Add and modify each object to be spatialized.
